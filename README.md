## Week 11 Challenge
I've added the requested codes for both exercises in files 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb' and 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb'.
i've added comments to the code for your reference.
in the 'Weather' exercise, question 1 "# 1. How many months are there on Mars?" was not clear.  I tried calculating the number of months asuming 30 martian days.
